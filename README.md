# Introduction to decision tables

## What the decision table is?

### From "Decision Tables: Theory and Practice" (1971)

> Tables are a familiar part of everyone's life. From mathematical tables to the box score of yesterday's
> baseball game, they provide us with an orderly presentation of data. While such tables often assist us
> in making a decision, they are not decision tables. A decision table is a special form of table that
> codifies a set of decision rules based on a specific, clearly identified set of conditions and resulting
> actions. While the history of tables in general can be told in terms of centuries,
> decision tables are fairly recent phenomenon.

> [Decision table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_table)
> 
> Decision tables are a concise visual representation for specifying which actions to perform depending on given conditions.
> They are algorithms whose output is a set of actions. The information expressed in decision tables could also be represented
> as decision trees or in a programming language as a series of if-then-else and switch-case statements.

### DMN (2024)

[Decision Model and Notation specification v1.5](https://www.omg.org/spec/DMN)

> A decision table is a tabular representation of a set of related input and output expressions, organized into rules
> indicating which output entry applies to a specific set of input entries. The decision table contains all (and only) the
> inputs required to determine the output. Moreover, a complete table contains all possible combinations of input
> values (all the rules). Decision tables and decision table hierarchies have a proven track record in decision
> logic representation. It is one of the purposes of **DMN** to standardize different forms and types of decision tables.

> A decision table is a structured representation of decision logic that helps in organizing complex decision-making processes.
> It's a tool used in systems analysis and software engineering for specifying, organizing, and modeling complex logic.
> Decision tables are particularly useful when dealing with multiple conditions and actions, making them popular in fields
> like business analysis, software development, and operations research.
>
> In a decision table, each column represents a condition or input variable, and each row represents a combination of conditions.
> The intersection of a row and column represents a specific scenario or combination of conditions.
> The table then specifies the actions or outcomes associated with each combination of conditions.
>
> Decision tables are often used in conjunction with decision trees and other decision-making tools to model and analyze
> complex decision processes. They provide a clear and concise way to document decision logic, making it easier to understand,
> validate, and modify decision-making rules. Additionally, decision tables can aid in identifying redundancies,
> inconsistencies, or gaps in decision logic.
